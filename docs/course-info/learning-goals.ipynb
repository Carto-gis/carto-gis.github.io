    "\n",
    "**After week 1, you should be able to:**\n",
    "* Grasp the evolution of cartographic theory and its connection to contemporary map-making.\n",
    "* Comprehend map design and color theory, applying these to create compelling and effective visual representations.\n",
    "* View cartography not only as a technical skill but also as an artistic endeavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After week 2, you should be able to:**\n",
    "* Understand how new technologies and the advent of big data have transformed cartography.\n",
    "* Recognize the importance of coordinate systems and map projections in crafting accurate maps.\n",
    "* Identify design elements that aesthetically enhance maps.\n",
    "* Produce various types of maps to visualize dense point data, including point maps, grid maps, and heatmaps.\n",
    "* Create visually appealing global static maps.\n",
    "* Acknowledge that geospatial data can be visualized in non-cartographic forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After week 3, you should be able to:**\n",
    "* Understand the art of storytelling with geospatial data.\n",
    "* Grasp the principles of critical cartography.\n",
