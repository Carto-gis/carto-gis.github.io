    "## Overview\n",
    "In this exercise, you have the freedom to select your dataset. The main goal is to create a correct and aesthetically pleasing choropleth map. Utilize the concepts discussed during the lecture and the discussion session to enhance your map. As the focus is on the map's quality, any suitbale geospatial dataset will suffice. You can find a lot of data sources from the internet.

    "When creating your choropleth map, consider the following aspects:\n",
    "- **Color Choice**: Select colors that effectively convey information and are accessible.\n",
    "- **Projection**: Choose a suitable projection.\n",
    "- **Map Elements**: Include essential elements.\n",
    "- **Layout**: Organize the spatial elements cohesively and ensure that the layout supports the map's purpose and readability.\n",

    "## Submission Requirements\n",
    "Along with your map, submit a brief reflection (approximately half a page) discussing what you learned from this week’s lecture and discussion. Highlight how these insights were incorporated into your map design. Provide a rationale for crucial decisions made during the map-making process, such as choice of projection, color schemes, and inclusion of specific map elements. Conclude by describing what your map reveals and how your cartographic choices influence this interpretation. \n",
